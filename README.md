2. **User Funds Deposit:**
   - Users deposit funds into FairLauncher.fun for participating in a token launch.
   - They provide their user ID, token ID, and the amount they wish to deposit.
   - FairLauncher.fun verifies the deposit and updates the user's balance accordingly.

3. **Token Burn Operation:**
   - Authorized users can burn tokens through FairLauncher.fun by specifying the amount of tokens they want to burn.
   - FairLauncher.fun verifies the request and updates the total token supply accordingly.

4. **Admin Pause/Resume Token Launch:**
   - FairLauncher.fun allows admins to pause or resume token launches as needed.
   - Admins provide the token ID and specify whether they want to pause or resume the launch process.
   - FairLauncher.fun processes the request and updates the launch status accordingly.
